### Day 1: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the tutorial of Wes Bos JavaScript30 Drum Kit Challenge and coded along. 

**Thoughts** I tried my best to figure out how to solve the challenge by myself, but definitely needed the tutorial. I feel like I have a better understanding of JavaScript event listeners though.
